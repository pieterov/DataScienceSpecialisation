# QUESTION 1:
#----------------------------------------
# Which of the following are components in building 
# a machine learning algorithm?

# Answer: Collecting data to answer the question.

# Asking the right question. Is also correct answer

# Not the answer: Training and test sets


# QUESTION 2:
#----------------------------------------
# Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it
# is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not
# work well if we collect a new data set

# Answer: Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, 
# predicting both the signal and the noise.


# QUESTION 3:
#----------------------------------------
# What are typical sizes for the training
# and test sets?

# Answer: 80% training set, 20% test set. Also correct.

# 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set. Is correct answer


# QUESTION 4:
#----------------------------------------
# What are some common error rates for predicting
# binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible
# values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't
# click)? Check the correct answer(s).

# Answer: Predictive value of a positive

# Root mean squared error - not right?? because it is about binary?
# Median absolute deviation - not right??  because it is about binary?
# Sensitivity
# Predictive value of a positive


# QUESTION 5:
#----------------------------------------
# Suppose that we have created a machine learning
# algorithm that predicts whether a link will be 
# clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity.
# The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits
# to a website. If we predict the link will be
# clicked on a specific visit, what is the
# probability it will actually be clicked?

# Answer: 9%
