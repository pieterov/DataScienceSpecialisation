### P. Overdevest / Dec 11, 2016

Upon request from the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' the dataset has been re-worked over a number of steps. See 'run_analysis.R'

==================================================================

### The revised dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R': The R-code that reworks the provided data into the datasets as stored in 'merged_test_and training_data.txt',                     'averages_by_activity.txt', 'averages_by_subject.txt'.

- 'Codebook merged_test_and_training_data.md': Explains the variables in 'merged_test_and_training_data.txt'.

- 'Codebook averages_by_activity.md': Explains the variables in 'averages_by_activity.txt'.

- 'Codebook averages_by_subject.md': Explains the variables in 'averages_by_subject.txt'.

- 'merged_test_and_training_data.txt': .

- 'averages_by_activity.txt': Training labels.

- 'averages_by_subject.txt': Test set.

- 'descriptive names.txt': Provides a better descriptive names of the variables - which have been assigned to the data, see Codebooks.


### Notes:
